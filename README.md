 ESP32 water tank project, here's a high-level approach:

1. **Components Needed**:
   - ESP32 board
   - Ultrasonic sensor (e.g., HC-SR04) to measure water levels
   - Relay module to control the motor
   - Motor (for water pump)
   - Discord webhook for notifications

2. **Code Outline**:
   - **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measure the distance to the water surface to estimate the water level.
   - **Motor Control**: Use the relay module to turn the motor on/off depending on the water level.
   - **Webhook Notification**: Send a POST request to the Discord webhook when the water level is < 25% or at 100%.

3. **Basic Workflow**:
   - Initialize the ultrasonic sensor and measure the water level.
   - If water level < 50%, turn on the motor.
   - If water level = 100%, turn off the motor.
   - If water level < 25%, send a low-level alert to Discord via webhook.
   - If water level = 100%, send a full-tank alert to Discord.
